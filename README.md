# Recreating JavaScriptCore Concepts

This project aims to understand how JavaScript works by recreating its core behaviors using TypeScript.

It explores key JavaScript features, such as variable scoping, function execution, and event handling, and how these are managed and simulated internally in TypeScript.

By rebuilding JavaScriptâ€™s fundamental mechanics, the project offers a hands-on approach to learning how JavaScript operates behind the scenes. It also provides insights into the runtime behavior and underlying concepts that drive its execution.
